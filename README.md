## Overview

Nuxt offers first-class support for e2e and unit testing of your Nuxt applications. `@nuxt/test-utils` currently contains e2e test utilities allowing you to test your app in production/development environments, and [`nuxt-vitest`](https://github.com/danielroe/nuxt-vitest) is planned to be merged to provide unit testing capabilities.

Nuxt Test Utils is currently powering [the tests we use on Nuxt itself](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/tree/main/test), as well as tests used throughout the module ecosystem.
